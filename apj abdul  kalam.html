    <p><strong>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian e 11th president
        of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
        involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts[1] . He thus came to be
        known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology <sup>[2][3][4]</sup> . He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
        India's
        Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
